Three tanneries, including the Salz Tannery, operated where Pogonip Creek meets the San Lorenzo River. The tanneries fueled the economy of Santa Cruz County and the Central Coast over the span of 145 years. From 1843 until 2001, with a few gap years when operations slowed, the tanneries turned hides into leather products, using tannins from tanoak bark. The bark was stripped from a tree that is a relative of the oak genus and is native to the Santa Cruz Mountains, Notholithocarpus densiflorus. The building in which our cafe now resides was originally the Tanoak Mill House, a long freight barn where these strips of bark were stored. Bistro One Twelve took its name from our suite number within this building, and the logo from the acorn produced by the tanoak tree.

But wait, what happened to The Dead Cow?! While the cow had a great run (and will still be making appearances at pop-ups and bbqs!), we felt that we needed an updated image to better represent our business focus. Bistro One Twelve will feature a new coffee program in partnership with 11th Hour Coffee, upscale bistro food offerings, and expanded evening hours.
