The Dead Cow is “Decidedly Local & Aggressively Seasonal.” We’re lucky to be located within arm’s reach of Salinas Valley and to have 5 local farmer’s markets right here in Santa Cruz from which to choose. Our menu changes seasonally based on product inspiration, availability, and whim. Our food is always prepared fresh, from scratch, with love.

Read through a description of our menu below, or check out our Seasonal Selections for our current menu items and Specials of the Moment. Our food is casual European-inspired “bistro” cuisine with a multi-ethnic California flair.

The Dead Cow is opening in stages, some items may not yet be available. Evening service will be available by announcement, check out our [Facebook Page](http://www.facebook.com/deadcowsc) for details!
