Three tanneries, including the Salz Tannery, operated where Pogonip Creek meets the San Lorenzo River. The tanneries fueled the economy of Santa Cruz County and the Central Coast over the span of 145 years. In the late ‘60’s, Salz Tannery President [?] Lezin offered his son, 15 year old Jeremy Lezin, the opportunity to sell leather scraps from the tannery. Jeremy cleaned out an old lawnmower shed and opened up shop as The Dead Cow, which thrived for over a decade. The Salz family owned and operated the business until it closed in 2001 due to the lower-cost leather production in China and Asia.
The Redevelopment Agency of the City of Santa Cruz acquired the property in 2003, eventually handing over the title to the City of Santa Cruz. The Santa Cruz Economic Development Department, in partnership with Artspace Projects Inc., renovated the historic buildings of the Tannery to create the Tannery Lofts and the Working Studios. Resident visionary, artist, salesman, curator and all-around ideas man, Kirby Scudder, established the first creative effort at the Tannery by launching The Dead Cow Gallery.
Our name pays homage to the rich history of the Tannery, and to the efforts of those involved in guiding its course towards its current creative purpose.
