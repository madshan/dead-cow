                        Driven by the Farm-to-Table philosophies of our chefs, Shannon and JP, our Mission is to serve the Santa Cruz Tannery Arts Center with a family and artist-friendly food and beverage community gathering place. We create local, organic, sustainable menus that are vegan first, with dairy for flavor enhancement, and a reduced emphasis on animal proteins. We offer casual preparations with fine-dining attention to detail and quality. Our plates are inspired by the mediterranean climate and produce of California. We aim to have a welcoming venue with a great tasting food and beverage draw, while catering to popular dietary restrictions with locally and sustainably-sourced, healthy preparations.
